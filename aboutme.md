Hi, I'm Anthony Frazier, a graduate statistics student attending Colorado State University. My research interests include topics in machine learning and causal inference. Specficially, I've been interested in Difference-in-Differences analyses, as well as various topics in ensemble methods. I recieved my B.S. in Computational Statistics and Data Science with a Minor in Computer Science from Weber State University. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball and tennis, as well as writing music and playing board games.
