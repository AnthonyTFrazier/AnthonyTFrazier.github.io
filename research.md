Abstract: The difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator is a widely used tool for research in economics, political science, and public policy to evaluate the effects of public policy on a response variable. In this paper, we use simulations to compare the standard DiD estimator with the bracketed difference-in-differences (bDiD) approach of Hasegawa et al. (2019) that is robust to the existence of unobserved confounding variables in certain conditions. We highlight trade-offs between these approaches in a variety of cases that vary assumptions about the influence of confounding variables. We then apply both approaches in an analysis of the effect of medical marijuana legalization on violent crime. We do not find a negative effect of medical marijuana legalization on violent crime as some recent analyses have. We show that the context provided by our simulations is helpful in interpreting the results in this data application
