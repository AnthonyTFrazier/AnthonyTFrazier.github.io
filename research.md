Abstract: The difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator is a widely used tool for research in economics, political science, and public policy to evaluate the effects of public policy on a response variable. In this paper, we use simulations to compare the standard DiD estimator with the bracketed difference-in-differences (bDiD) approach of Hasegawa et al. (2019) that is robust to the existence of unobserved confounding variables in certain conditions. We highlight trade-offs between these approaches in a variety of cases that vary assumptions about the influence of confounding variables. We then apply both approaches in an analysis of the effect of medical marijuana legalization on violent crime. We do not find a negative effect of medical marijuana legalization on violent crime as some recent analyses have. We show that the context provided by our simulations is helpful in interpreting the results in this data application

Abstract: In this study, we examine a set of primary data collected from 484 students enrolled in a large public university in the Mid-Atlantic United States region during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, called Ties data, included students’ demographic and support network information. The support network data comprised of information that highlighted the type of support, (i.e. emotional or educational; routine or intense). Using this data set, models for predicting students’ academic achievement, quantified by their self-reported GPA, were created using Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), a decision tree algorithm, and cforest, a random forest algorithm that uses conditional inference trees. We compare the methods’ accuracy and variation in the set of important variables suggested by each algorithm. Each algorithm found different variables important for different student demographics with some overlap. For White students, different types of educational support were important in predicting academic achievement, while for non-White students, different types of emotional support were important in predicting academic achievement. The presence of differing types of routine support were important in predicting academic achievement for cisgender women, while differing types of intense support were important in predicting academic achievement for cisgender men.
